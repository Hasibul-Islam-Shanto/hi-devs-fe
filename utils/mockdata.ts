    content: `In React 18 strict mode, effects are intentionally double-invoked to help catch bugs. Here's how to properly handle cleanup:

\`\`\`typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const controller = new AbortController();
  
  fetchData(controller.signal)
    .then(setData)
    .catch(err => {
      if (err.name !== 'AbortError') {
        setError(err);
      }
    });

  return () => controller.abort();
}, []);
\`\`\`

Key points:
1. Always return a cleanup function for subscriptions and async operations
2. Use AbortController for fetch requests
3. Clean up timers with clearInterval/clearTimeout`,
